# Assignment-Slides

Here are the instructions for delivering the LaTeX slides you need to provide based on the poaper you presented in class.

1. Fork the [Slides Presentations](https://github.com/econgrowth/slides-presentations) repository.
2. Use Github Desktop to download it to your computer.
3. Create a subdirectory with the name of the paper and authors. The subdirectory should be similar to the name of the LaTeX file, i.e. ``Author1-Author2-Author3-...-Title-Year``.
4. Push a PR with your slides.
5. Copy the subdirectory and files to the repository of this assignment and push it, so it can be reviewed.

Do not forget to put your name and some contact information in the comments of the LaTeX file and also visibly in the slides.
